Given array: [16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge Sort
1- Write down the steps of the given array according to the sorting type.
```
                [16,21,11,8,12,22]
               /                 \
     [16,21,11]                  [8,12,22]
       /     \                     /     \
  [16,21]   [11]               [8,12]   [22]
   /  \       |                 /  \      |
[16] [21]   [11]              [8] [12]  [22]
 \    /       |                \   /      |
[16,21]     [11]               [8,12]   [22]
     \      /                     \      /
    [11,16,21]                  [8,12,22]
            \                    /
               [8,11,12,16,21,22]
 ```
 2- Write the Big-O notation.
 ```
 O(nlogn)

# Kodluyoruz-Binary-Search-Tree-Project

-Write the Binary Search Tree steps for the array [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2].

-Example: root is x. To the right of root, find y. To the left of y, find z, and so on.
Root:7
```
                          7
